# Tomcat 7 Template

An [IBM Cloud Schematics](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/schematics/index.html) template that allocates a virtual machine instance and provisions Apache Tomcat onto the instance.

Schematics uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as the infrastructure as code engine. With this template, you can provision and manage infrastructure as a single unit.

See the [Terraform provider docs](https://ibm-bluemix.github.io/tf-ibm-docs/) for available resource for the IBM cloud.

## Create an environment with this template

Environments can be used to separate software components into development tiers (e.g. staging, QA, and production).

1. In Bluemix, go to the menu and select the [Schematics dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/schematics).
2. In the left navigation menu, select **Templates** to access the template catalog.
3. Click **Create** on the Tomcat7 template. You are taken to a configuration page where you can define metadata about your environment. 
4. In the **Variables** section:
  a. Set the value of `temp_public_key` to `$SCHEMATICS.SSHKEYPUBLIC` to use the Schematics generated key pair for the environment.
  b. Set the value of `temp_private_key` to `$SCHEMATICS.SSHKEYPRIVATE` to use the Schematics generated key pair for the environment.
  c. If you want to be able to SSH into the virtual machine provide a value for `public_key`
5. Define values for your [variables](#variables).

**NOTE:** The file `/root/tomcat` has the associated credentials & access information.

## Next steps

After setting up your environment with this template, you can run **Plan** to preview how Schematics will deploy resources to your environment. When you are ready to deploy the cluster, run **Apply**.
